Future lesson ideas:

1. Set up your own coding environment

A lesson revolving around bashrc, vimrc, jupyter, atom, vscode, and whatever other coding thing ppl want. 
The goal is to make sure that people get what they want installed on their own system. 

2. Structural bio

Protein modelling, homology, interaction. How do we make coding exercises that are manageable for our server-based teaching
model while actually doing something kind of practical?

3. Hidden Markov Models

HMM's profile alignment, emulating cell conditions, and more. How do we do this without going too close to pavel territory?
Maybe a lesson revolving around the use of HMMER?
