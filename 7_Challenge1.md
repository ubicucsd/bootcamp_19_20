# Challenge 1

## Welcome
Welcome to Week 4 of the Crash Course! This will be our final session this quarter; good luck with finals, and we'll see you in Winter.

This week's lesson is, in some ways, a "midterm" that covers the skills you've learned in Weeks 1-3. It is designed to be more representative of problems you'd be asked to solve in real world applications rather than a tutorial explaining how things are done. 

## Instructions
### Coverage
We assume that you've already covered (and only covered) all three of our previous sessions. For your referece, they're linked here: [Week 1](/1_Welcome.md) [Week 2](/3_AdvancedTerminal.md) [Week 3](/5_Biopython.md). The techniques for solving each problem below are, with 100% certainty, covered in the previous three lessons. 

*Note: This does not mean that they are explicitly mentioned in one of our previous lessons. Recall that we emphasize finding specific commands, options, and tools on your own. However, we have covered the core concepts before.*

### Logistics
The problems below will never specify *how* you should solve a problem. Instead, we'll present you with some data, a task to perform, and you'll need to determine the output. Please write down these answers somewhere.

Additionally, you'll never need to download any software. Everything you need is on EC2.

### Getting Help
In the real world, you're often on your own when you're stuck and need help. Reading through Google searches, documentations, tutorials, and manuals is a real life skill. 

However, we don't just want to throw you off the deep end. If you do get stuck on something and you can't figure it out, you can draft and email and send it to both Sabeel and Mark. Provide a specific description of 1) what you're trying to accomplish 2) what issue you're running into 3) what you've already tried to troubleshoot it. We'll get back to you as soon as we can, but move on to a different problem in the meantime.

### Good luck, have fun!
