# Bioinformatics x Python

## Introduction

This lesson is a continuation of our previous lesson, Intro to Python, located [here](https://github.com/sabeelmansuri/binf_crash_course/blob/master/3_Python.md). If you're having trouble following this tutorial, are new to Python, or just want a refresher, check that lesson out first.

## Setup

We're going to start by using a Python package called [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) to perform a few common bioinformatic tasks. Biopython is already installed on the cluster. You can prove this to yourself by typing the following on the command line:

```shell
pip list
```

## Sequences

### Seq objects

The first thing you think of when you hear "genetic data" is probably a sequence of DNA, which is a string of nucleotides (A's C's G's and T's). Let's use Biopython to work with sequences. Create a file to work in.

First, import the Seq package:

```python
 from Bio.Seq import Seq
```

Next, create a Seq object (think of that as a sequence) and assign it to a dna variable:
```python
dna = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
```

Now, print out that variable:
```python
print dna
```

### Loading sequences

In reality, you're probably not going to be typing in your A-G-C-T's--you'll be using a fasta file containing them. 

Now to parse, we can load a fasta file to work with. Create a new file and import the SeqIO package:
 
 ```python
from Bio import SeqIO
for seq_record in SeqIO.parse("ls_orchid.fasta", "fasta"):
   print(seq_record.id)
   print(repr(seq_record.seq))
   print(len(seq_record))
```

 Before you run this program, take a guess what will print (confirm with a neighbor!). Were you right? If not, what printed and why?
 

## Complements and Transcription

You've probably heard of complementary strands and transcription. If you haven't, here are two excellent sources: [transcription](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/transcription-of-dna-into-rna/a/overview-of-transcription) and [complements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarity_(molecular_biology)). Biopython can perform these actions too!

### Complements

Create a new file and import the Seq package again. Create a Seq object with a DNA strand of your choosing (A's C's G's and T's only!). Call the `complement()` method on your Seq object. What do you expect will print out? Does it?

### Transcription

**Make sure you understand transcription before moving on**

Copy and paste the following into a new file:

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq
template_dna = Seq("ATGGCCATTGTAATGGGCCGCTGAAAGGGTGCCCGATAG")
```
You've been given a template DNA strand. Can you turn this into the transcribed RNA strand? 

**Hint: You'll need the `reverse_complement()` before you `transcribe()`**

## NCBI BLAST

We connected to the BLAST database last time (take a look if you haven't already!). The output, however, wasn't very nice. Biopython can clear that up for us. 

Let's prepare to BLAST. Instead of explicitly specifying a fasta sequence, we're going to instead use a [gi number](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sequenceids/). Don't worry too much about this--just know we're running BLAST on some sequence, even though we haven't specified it with A's G's C's and T's.

```python
from Bio.Blast import NCBIWWW
from Bio.Blast import NCBIXML
result_handle = NCBIWWW.qblast("blastn", "nt", "8332116")
blast_record = NCBIXML.read(result_handle)
for alignment in blast_record.alignments:
  for hsp in alignment.hsps:
    if hsp.expect < 8.02643e-114:
      print("****Alignment****")
      print("sequence:", alignment.title)
      print("length:", alignment.length)
      print("e value:", hsp.expect)
      print(hsp.query[0:75] + "...")
      print(hsp.match[0:75] + "...")
      print(hsp.sbjct[0:75] + "...")
```
Look through the code, and look through [this documentation](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.Blast.Record.HSP-class.html) (side note: a lot of coding/bioinformatics is looking through documentation--this is a valuable exercise that you shouldn't just skip!). What do you expect will print? Run the program to check.

## Your turn!

There's only one (fairly easy) challenge for this half of today's lesson, and it comes with starter code! Your task is to write a program that asks for two DNA sequences, concatenates them, and prints out the complement and reverse complement.

Starter code:
```python
seq1 = raw_input("First sequence: ")
seq2 = raw_input("Second sequence: ")

print "Complement of strings: "
print "Reverse complement of strings: "
```

### ðŸ”¸ You've completed the first part of today's lesson. Move on to the next part on alignment located [here](https://github.com/sabeelmansuri/binf_crash_course/blob/master/5_Alignment.md).
